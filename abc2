Git is one of the most powerful tools for version control in software development.
It helps developers keep track of changes in their codebase efficiently.
Branches in Git allow teams to work on different features without disturbing the main project.
For example, you can create a branch for a new feature and merge it later into the main branch.
This avoids conflicts and keeps the project organized.
When a feature is complete, merging combines the work into the target branch.
Conflicts may arise, but Git provides clear markers to resolve them.
Developers can also push their branches to GitHub for collaboration.
Pull requests enable code review and team discussions before merging.
Overall, Git branching and merging ensure smooth teamwork and reliable project history.
